# Playwright-Based Copilot Assignment

## Overview

The Automated Development Cycle now uses **Playwright** to assign `@copilot` to GitHub issues via the GitHub web UI instead of using the GitHub API directly. This approach provides a more realistic and visual way to interact with GitHub, making the automation process more transparent and easier to debug.

## Why Playwright?

### Benefits

1. **UI-Based Interaction**: Interacts with GitHub exactly as a human would through the web interface
2. **Visual Debugging**: Screenshots are captured at each step for troubleshooting
3. **Realistic Workflow**: Demonstrates the actual user experience of assignment
4. **Fallback Support**: Automatically falls back to API if UI automation fails

### Trade-offs

- **Performance**: Slightly slower than direct API calls (adds ~5-10 seconds per assignment)
- **Complexity**: Requires browser automation dependencies (Playwright + Chromium)
- **Authentication**: More complex than API token authentication

## Implementation Details

### Files Added

1. **`.github/scripts/assign-copilot-via-ui.js`**
   - Main Playwright automation script
   - Handles browser launch, navigation, and interaction
   - Captures screenshots for debugging
   - Implements error handling and retries

2. **`.github/scripts/package.json`**
   - Node.js package configuration
   - Declares Playwright dependency
   - Provides installation scripts

### Workflow Changes

The `copilot-automated-development-cycle.yml` workflow now includes:

1. **Issue Creation Step** (Modified)
   - Creates issues via API
   - Stores issue numbers for Playwright
   - No longer assigns directly via API

2. **Playwright Setup Steps** (New)
   - Checks out repository
   - Sets up Node.js environment
   - Installs Playwright and Chromium browser

3. **Playwright Assignment Step** (New)
   - Runs `assign-copilot-via-ui.js` for each issue
   - Passes repository info and issue numbers
   - Captures screenshots of the process

4. **Screenshot Upload Step** (New)
   - Uploads Playwright screenshots as artifacts
   - Retained for 7 days for debugging

5. **API Fallback Step** (New)
   - Checks if assignments succeeded
   - Falls back to GitHub API if Playwright failed
   - Adds labels for manual review if both fail

## Playwright Script Details

### Authentication

The script attempts multiple authentication strategies:

1. **GitHub Token Headers**: Sets Authorization header with PAT token
2. **Session Cookies**: Uses GitHub session cookies if available (via `GITHUB_COOKIE_USER_SESSION`)
3. **Note**: PAT tokens alone cannot authenticate browser sessions; requires proper OAuth flow or session cookies

### UI Interaction Flow

```javascript
1. Launch Chromium browser in headless mode
2. Navigate to issue URL: https://github.com/{owner}/{repo}/issues/{number}
3. Wait for page load and authentication check
4. Locate assignees button (tries multiple selectors)
5. Click to open assignees dropdown
6. Search for copilot username
7. Click on copilot user in results
8. Take screenshot of final state
9. Close browser
```

### Selectors Used

The script tries multiple CSS selectors for robustness:

**Assignees Button:**
- `[aria-label="Select assignees"]`
- `button[aria-label="Select assignees"]`
- `.sidebar-assignee button`
- `[data-hotkey="a"]`
- `summary:has-text("Assignees")`

**Search Input:**
- `input[placeholder*="Type or choose"]`
- `input[type="text"][aria-label*="assignee"]`
- `input.js-filterable-field`
- `input[name="query"]`

**User Selection:**
- `[data-filterable-for*="${copilotUsername}"]`
- `.select-menu-item:has-text("${copilotUsername}")`
- `a:has-text("${copilotUsername}")`
- `.menu-item:has-text("${copilotUsername}")`

### Error Handling

1. **Timeout Protection**: All operations have configurable timeouts
2. **Screenshot Capture**: Takes screenshots at each major step
3. **Graceful Degradation**: Returns success/failure status for fallback logic
4. **Detailed Logging**: Emits emoji-prefixed logs for easy debugging

### Screenshots

Screenshots are saved to `/tmp/` with descriptive names:

- `github-issue-page.png` - Initial page load
- `github-assignees-open.png` - After opening assignees
- `github-search-results.png` - After searching for user
- `github-final.png` - Final state after assignment
- `github-error.png` - Error state if something fails

## Configuration

### Environment Variables

**Required:**
- `GITHUB_TOKEN`: GitHub Personal Access Token with `repo` and `issues:write` scopes

**Optional:**
- `GITHUB_COOKIE_USER_SESSION`: GitHub session cookie for authenticated requests (currently not fully supported)
- `COPILOT_USER`: Username to assign (defaults to 'copilot')
- `COPILOT_AGENT_USER`: Workflow-level setting for agent username

### Workflow Inputs

```yaml
workflow_dispatch:
  inputs:
    assign_unassigned:
      description: 'Assign Copilot to unassigned issues'
      required: false
      default: true
      type: boolean
```

## Running Locally

### Prerequisites

```bash
cd .github/scripts
npm install
```

### Manual Execution

```bash
export GITHUB_TOKEN="your_github_token"
node assign-copilot-via-ui.js <owner> <repo> <issue-number> [copilot-username]
```

**Example:**
```bash
export GITHUB_TOKEN="ghp_..."
node assign-copilot-via-ui.js PMeeske Ouroboros 123 copilot
```

### Debug Mode

To see the browser in action (non-headless):

Edit `assign-copilot-via-ui.js`:
```javascript
browser = await chromium.launch({
  headless: false,  // Change to false
  args: ['--no-sandbox', '--disable-setuid-sandbox']
});
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### 1. Playwright Installation Fails

**Symptom**: Workflow fails during "Install Playwright dependencies"

**Solution**:
```yaml
- name: Install Playwright dependencies
  run: |
    npm install
    npx playwright install-deps  # Add system dependencies
    npx playwright install chromium --with-deps
```

#### 2. Authentication Fails

**Symptom**: Script shows "Not authenticated" or redirects to login page

**Explanation**: GitHub PAT tokens cannot be used for browser authentication. The current implementation documents this limitation.

**Workaround**: The workflow includes an API fallback that handles this case.

#### 3. Selectors Break After GitHub UI Update

**Symptom**: "Could not find assignees button" error

**Solution**: Update the selectors array in `assign-copilot-via-ui.js` with new GitHub selectors.

#### 4. Screenshots Not Uploaded

**Symptom**: No artifacts in workflow run

**Check**:
- Screenshots are saved to `/tmp/` directory
- Artifact upload step runs (even on failure via `if: always()`)
- Check artifact retention policy (7 days by default)

### Debugging Tips

1. **View Screenshots**: Download artifacts from workflow run to see what Playwright saw
2. **Check Logs**: Playwright script emits detailed logs with emojis for easy scanning
3. **Run Locally**: Test the script on your machine with debug mode enabled
4. **API Fallback Logs**: Check if fallback mechanism engaged and succeeded

## Known Limitations

### GitHub Authentication

**Issue**: GitHub does not support PAT token authentication for browser sessions.

**Impact**: The Playwright script may not be able to authenticate and perform assignments through the UI.

**Mitigation**: 
- Workflow includes API fallback for reliable operation
- Screenshots document the authentication state
- Future enhancement: OAuth flow integration

### Performance

- Playwright adds ~5-10 seconds per issue assignment
- For bulk assignments (>10 issues), consider API-only mode

### Browser Resources

- Requires Chromium browser installation (~200MB)
- Uses headless mode to reduce resource consumption
- May require increased timeout for low-resource environments

## Future Enhancements

### Planned Improvements

1. **OAuth Integration**: Implement proper GitHub OAuth flow for browser authentication
2. **Session Management**: Cache authenticated session cookies between runs
3. **Parallel Execution**: Assign to multiple issues concurrently with browser contexts
4. **Retry Logic**: Implement exponential backoff for transient failures
5. **Metrics**: Track success rate and performance of Playwright vs API

### Possible Extensions

- Support for other GitHub actions (labeling, commenting)
- Integration with GitHub CLI for easier authentication
- Visual regression testing for GitHub UI changes
- Webhook-based triggering of assignments

## Testing

### Automated Tests

Run the test suite:
```bash
./scripts/test-copilot-workflows.sh
```

Tests validate:
- Playwright script exists
- Package.json configuration
- Workflow integration
- Fallback mechanisms
- .gitignore exclusions

### Manual Testing

1. Create a test issue in your repository
2. Run workflow with manual trigger
3. Check workflow logs for Playwright output
4. Download and review screenshots
5. Verify issue assignment in GitHub UI

## Best Practices

### When to Use Playwright

✅ **Use Playwright when:**
- You want visual proof of automation
- Debugging complex UI interactions
- Testing new GitHub UI features
- Demonstrating the automation process

❌ **Use API instead when:**
- Assigning to many issues (>10)
- Performance is critical
- Running in resource-constrained environments
- Authentication is properly configured

### Maintenance

1. **Monitor GitHub UI Changes**: GitHub updates its UI regularly; selectors may need updates
2. **Review Screenshots**: Periodically check uploaded screenshots for issues
3. **Update Dependencies**: Keep Playwright version current for latest browser support
4. **Test After Updates**: Run manual test after any GitHub UI or workflow changes

## Security Considerations

### Token Protection

- PAT tokens are stored as GitHub secrets
- Never log or expose tokens in output
- Tokens are passed via environment variables only

### Browser Security

- Headless mode reduces attack surface
- Sandbox flags prevent breakout attempts
- Browsers are isolated per run
- No persistent data stored

### Screenshot Privacy

- Screenshots may contain sensitive repository information
- Artifacts are retained for only 7 days
- Access controlled by repository permissions
- Consider disabling in public repositories if needed
