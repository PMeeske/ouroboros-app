## 🎯 What Problem Does This Solve?

The CliSteps.cs file provides critical functionality for the Ouroboros CLI, but has accumulated technical debt that conflicts with the project's functional programming philosophy. Specifically:

### Functional Programming Violations
The file uses imperative error handling (try-catch) instead of the monadic Result<T> pattern used elsewhere in the codebase. This makes composition harder and reduces type safety.

**Example Issue:**
```csharp
// Current: Imperative with side effects
try {
    s.Branch = await operation(s.Branch);
} catch (Exception ex) {
    s.Branch = s.Branch.WithError(ex.Message);
}
```

**Should be:**
```csharp
// Monadic with explicit error handling
var result = await SafeOperation(s);
return result.Match(
    success: newState => newState,
    failure: error => s.WithError(error));
```

### Code Duplication
UseDir and UseDirBatched share 90% of their code (180+ lines), making maintenance error-prone.

### Complexity
Some methods exceed 100 lines and handle 5+ responsibilities, violating the Single Responsibility Principle.

## 🚀 Implementation Roadmap

### Week 1-2: Foundation (Phase 1)
```
✓ Day 1-2: Create Result extensions and config types
✓ Day 3-4: Refactor UseDir (proof-of-concept)
✓ Day 5-6: Refactor UseIngest, UseSolution
✓ Day 7-8: Refactor ZipIngest, ZipStream
```

### Week 3-4: Refinement (Phase 2)
```
✓ Day 9-10: Decompose RAG methods
✓ Day 11-12: Extract constants, refactor EnhanceMarkdown
✓ Day 13-14: Complete documentation
✓ Day 15: Testing and validation
```

### Week 5: Polish (Phase 3)
```
✓ Day 16-17: Improve chain integration
✓ Day 18: Final testing
✓ Day 19-22: Buffer for issues
```
